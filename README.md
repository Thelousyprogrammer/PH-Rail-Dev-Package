# Documentation
Hello there fellow developer!
My name's Thelousyprogrammer, and I created this repository for fellow Filipino developers who wanted to create a rail application for all rail lines. I have compiled here all of the fare prices and stations in all rail lines in order for developers who wanted to create an application to use this data and not compile everything you need! You can use this repository to pull and copy the files given in this repository to your project. For further questions or have any ideas on adding/improving for this repository, feel free to email me at Gmail with this address: exphysius@gmail.com for concerns or inquiries!

Have fun developing your rail project and don't forget:
Move people, not cars!
